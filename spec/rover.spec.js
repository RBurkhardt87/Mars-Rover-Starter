          receiveMessage(message)

    message is a Message object
    Returns an object containing at least two properties:
    message: the name of the original Message object
    results: an array of results. Each element in the array is an object that corresponds to one Command in message.commands.
    Updates certain properties of the rover object
    Details about how to respond to different commands are in the Command Types table.


                                {
                                  message: 'Test message with two commands',
                                  results: [
                                      {
                                        completed: true
                                      },
                                      {
                                        completed: true, 
                                        roverStatus: { mode: 'LOW_POWER', generatorWatts: 110, position: 98382 }
                                      }
                                  ]
                                } 
   
      THINK: THE FUNCTION IS WRITTEN AS AN OBJECT WITH 2 PROPERTIES (MESSAGE AND RESULTS). MESSAGE JUST RETURNS THE MESSAGE THE WAS SENT TO THE ROVER. 
      HOWEVER, RESULTS RETURNS AN ARRAY THAT HAS 2 OBJECTS INSIDE THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE COMMANDS THAT WERE PASSED IN. EACH OF THE OBJECTS INSIDE THE RESULTS ARRAY
      HAVE A KEY THAT CHECKS IF IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. 

      POSSIBLY: SET "COMPLETED" TO FALSE AND UPDATE TO TRUE IF IT WAS DONE
                STATUS CHECK SEEMS TO RETURN AN UPDATE ON PROPERTIES OF THE ROVER
                DECLARE A RESULTS ARRAY (LET RESULTS = [];)
                PUSH COMMANDS INTO THE ARRAY?? (RESULTS.PUSH(COMMANDS[0]);) --- BUT I NEED TO MAKE THE COMMANDS OBJECTS FIRST. 
                OR MAYBE I NEED TO WRITE CONDITIONALS TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE COMMANDS FOR UPDATES.
